# Confoo

Confoo is a Java library for discretely conformal transformations of
triangle meshes. It is based on the concept of
[Conformal Equivalence of Triangle Meshes][Siggraph08] outlined in a
paper by Boris Springborn, Peter Schr√∂der and Ulrich Pinkall.
Applications lie mainly in the field of 3D modelling,
especially in combination with periodic textures.

The author has been using this as the basis for the hyperbolization
of ornaments as described in his [dissertation][diss].
