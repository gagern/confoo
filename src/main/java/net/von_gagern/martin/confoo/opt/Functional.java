/**
 * Interface of a functional.<p>
 *
 * An implementation of this interface represents a function taking a
 * fixed number of real input values to compute a single real output
 * value. The gradient (first derivative) and hessian (second
 * derivative) of the function can be calculated as well.<p>
 *
 * The design of this class is intended to faciliate optimization. To
 * calculate the function itself, its gradient or its hessian at a
 * given location in input space, one first has to move the whole
 * function to that location using {@link #setArgument}. Subsequent
 * calls to return given values will always assume that location to be
 * the function input. It is up to the function implementation to
 * split work between <code>setArgument</code> and the other methods
 * in a suitable fashion. An implementation may throw an
 * <code>IllegalStateException</code> if there was no call to
 * <code>setArgument</code> preceding any of the result calculation
 * methods, but is not required to do so.<p>
 *
 * A common way to use this interface woule look like this:
 * <pre>
 * Functional functional = constructFunctional();
 * int size = functional.getInputDimension(size);
 * Vector x = constructInitialValue(size);
 * double value;
 * Vector gradient = null;
 * Matrix hessian = null;
 * while (/&#42; condition &#42;/) {
 *     functional.setArgument(x);
 *     value = functional.value();
 *     gradient = functional.gradient(gradient);
 *     hessian = functional.hessian(hessian);
 *     // work with results, modify x appropriately
 * }
 * </pre>
